# Charity Donation Tracker

## 1. Project Title
Charity Donation Tracker

## 2. Project Description
The Charity Donation Tracker is a Clarity smart contract that allows individuals to donate STX tokens directly to a predefined charity wallet. It maintains a public record of the total donations made, ensuring transparency and trust in the donation process.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent and secure platform where charitable organizations can receive direct blockchain donations and where anyone can verify the total amount donated without relying on third parties.

## 4. Future Scope
- Track donations from each user individually.
- Allow multiple charity wallets to be registered and managed.
- Implement events/logging for every donation for public audit.
- Add a withdrawal function for the charity to transfer received funds.
- Integrate with a front-end DApp for an easy donor interface.
